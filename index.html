          Bethan Cropper is a Graduate Software Engineer at THG, on the
          Accelerator programme. She has a PhD in Nuclear Physics from The
          University of Manchester (pending the viva) and has completed a
          six-month internship at the BBC in the AI and Machine Learning team of
          their R&D division. She is an excellent communicator with experience
          in science communication, having won
          <em>"I'm a Scientist, Get Me Out of Here!</em> and being involved with
          public outreach at the university and the BBC since her days as an
          undergraduate. Now, she is retraining for a career in software
          development at THG, and aims to put her natural curiosity and
          analytical skills to the new test of innovating for a globally
